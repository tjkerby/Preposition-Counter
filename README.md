# Preposition Counter

This was the first program that I wrote outside of my required coursework. I had taken a course in C++ and was in the middle of taking a second. At the time I was in a Technical Writing class where I had to do a 20 page literature review. The professor said that one of the requirements was to have no more than 3 prepositions in a sentence. This was a weakness of mine at the time and trying to change my writing style for such a big project seemed daunting.

To fix the problem I wrote this program which would take my literature review, written in my usual manner at the time, and would show me all of the sentences that had more than 3 prepositions as well as show me what the prepositions were in each of those sentences. In the end, using this program, I wasn't docked a single point for having too many prepositions :)
